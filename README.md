# YOLOv8 Real-Time Object Detection

A beginner-friendly object detection project using [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) and OpenCV.  
Detects objects in real-time using your webcam and annotates them with bounding boxes.

## Features
- Real-time detection with webcam
- Lightweight model (YOLOv8n)
- CPU-only support (no GPU needed)
- OpenCV visualization
- Easy to extend (image/video detection coming soon)

 # 🧠 Object Detection using Deep Learning

This project demonstrates an object detection system using deep learning models. It utilizes pre-trained models to detect objects in images and videos.

## 🚀 Features

- Detects multiple objects in real-time
- Uses OpenCV for image/video processing
- Supports image and webcam input
- Highlights detected objects with bounding boxes and labels

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- OpenCV
- Pretrained models (like SSD,

## 🧪 How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repository

## bash
git clone https://github.com/Aram-fqe/Object_Detection.git
cd Object_Detection
 
 
 **2. Install Requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Run the Detection Script
python object_detection.py

    📸 The script will open your webcam or use test images to detect and highlight objects


📌 TODO

Add support for video file input

Allow model selection (YOLO, SSD, etc.)

Improve accuracy and speed with GPU support
